NOTE: This project is no longer maintained.

This repo contains a buildbot config for a master and slave used to build a
few projects I'm tracking / working on. You should clone this repo into your
buildbot directory (/var/lib/buildbot on Debian), copy the relevant *.default
file into /etc/defaults and then start your build master / slave. Initially
this probably won't "just work" but it will eventually.
